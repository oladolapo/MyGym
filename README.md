# MyGym

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that takes data input and retrieves data, we aim to collect and process data while also maintaining code of ethics outlined by the IEEE computer society. We big our project by having a specific naming convention then after that we set up our SQL data base, we then go on to fill up our database table and columns with necessary data which also included text box and buttons for users to insert data.
After that, we write our code so the form can know what to do when user inserts data, when user submits data, it’s shown in a grid view, we test our code for errors and if it’s fine, we deploy the project.
